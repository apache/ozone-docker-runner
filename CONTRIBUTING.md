# Contributing

For general contribution guideline, please check the [Apache Ozone repository](https://github.com/apache/ozone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Development of the `ozone-runner` image happens on branch `master`, relevant changes are cherry-picked to branch `jdk11`.

## Local Build and Test

### Building

The image can be built simply by running the helper script `build.sh`:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
...
 => => naming to docker.io/apache/ozone-runner:dev
```

This will create a single-platform image for your architecture.

### Testing

To try the image locally with Ozone acceptance tests, define the version to be used:

```bash
export OZONE_RUNNER_VERSION=dev
```

then run [acceptance tests](https://github.com/apache/ozone/blob/master/hadoop-ozone/dist/src/main/compose/README.md) as needed.

## GitHub Workflows

If this is your first time working on the image, please enable GitHub Actions workflows after forking the repo.

### Building

Whenever changes are pushed to your fork, GitHub builds a multi-platform image (for `amd64` and `arm64`), and tags it with the commit SHA.  These images can be shared with other developers for feedback.  Workflow runs are listed at `https://github.com/<username>/ozone-docker-runner/actions`, images at `https://github.com/<username>/ozone-docker-runner/pkgs/container/ozone-runner`.

### Testing

To run complete Ozone CI with the custom image:

1. Create a new branch in your clone of `apache/ozone`.
2. Update `OZONE_RUNNER_IMAGE` to `ghcr.io/<username>/ozone-runner` in [check.yml](https://github.com/apache/ozone/blob/23b0505d2ee27004f6e6c770de09e03853cf7643/.github/workflows/check.yml#L137).
3. Update `docker.ozone-runner.version` to `<commit SHA>` in [hadoop-ozone/dist/pom.xml](https://github.com/apache/ozone/blob/23b0505d2ee27004f6e6c770de09e03853cf7643/hadoop-ozone/dist/pom.xml#L28).
4. Commit the change and push to your fork of `apache/ozone`.

## Publishing Docker Tags (for committers)

1. Fetch changes to your local clone.
2. Add a Git tag for the commit following the existing pattern `<date>-<n>-<flavor>`, where
   - `<n>` starts at 1, and is incremented if multiple images need to be published the same day)
   - `<flavor>` is `jdk21` or `jdk11`
3. Push the Git tag to the official repo (`apache/ozone-docker-runner`).  This will trigger a workflow to apply the tag to the Docker image.
4. If the change is relevant for Ozone 1.x versions, cherry-pick it to the `jdk11` branch.
5. Set `Fix Version` of the Jira issue to `runner-<date>-<n>-<flavor>`
