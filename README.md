# Apache Ozone Runner Base Image

[ozone-runner](https://github.com/apache/ozone-docker-runner) is the base image with tools for running and testing Apache Ozone, but does not include any Ozone artifacts.

Published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/ozone-runner) and [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/ozone-docker-runner/pkgs/container/ozone-runner).

Images are tagged by date, and come in two flavors: `jdk21` (for Ozone 2.0+) and `jdk11` (for Ozone 1.x).
